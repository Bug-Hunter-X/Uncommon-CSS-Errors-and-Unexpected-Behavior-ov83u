The solution depends on the specific error.  For invalid properties, check the CSS specification for valid property names and values.  Vendor prefixes should generally be avoided unless targeting very old browsers. If specificity is the issue, use more precise selectors to override styles.  Avoid using `!important` unless absolutely necessary, as it can make CSS hard to maintain.   Review your cascade order to be sure that styles are applied in the way you expect.
