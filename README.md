# Uncommon CSS Errors and Unexpected Behavior

This repository demonstrates some uncommon CSS errors that can lead to unexpected behavior and difficulties in debugging.  The examples focus on issues beyond simple typos and syntax errors, targeting problems that can be tricky to identify.

The `bug.css` file contains the buggy code, and the `bugSolution.css` file provides the corrected version with explanations.

**Errors Covered:**
